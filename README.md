## Instrumenting Java Applications using OpenTelemetry

This project provides an example of microservice written in Java that produces telemetry data for traces and metrics using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io). It also shows how to de-couple the application from the observability backend using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector) and the [OTLP protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol), so you can be easily switch the observability backend for another without code changes.

💡 If you want to learn how to build this code from scratch with a hands-on tutorial, you can watch the YouTube series below.

### Requirements

* [Java 17+](https://openjdk.org/install)
* [Maven 3.8.6+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## 🏢 Running the microservice with Grafana, Grafana Tempo, and Prometheus as observability backend.

You can have the microservice sending telemetry data to a local observability backend. Traces will be sent to [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/traces) and the metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). Then you can use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana) to visualize the the generated telemetry data.

1. Start the containers using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

2. Access the Grafana UI: http://localhost:3000

## 🌩 Running the microservice with AWS X-Ray and Amazon CloudWatch as observability backend.

You can have the microservice sending telemetry data to AWS as observability backend. Traces will be sent to [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray) and the metrics to [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch). This is possible thanks to the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/otel) that provides out-of-the-box integration with AWS services. Before running the code; make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) in your machine, as the code will use them to connect with the target services.

1. Start the containers using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-aws.yaml up -d
```

2. Access the AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com

## ⚡️ Invoke the Microservice API manually

The microservice expose an API over the port 8888 using HTTP.

1. Invoke this API for testing purposes.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/hello
```
